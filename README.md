# DBS-Project
Flood Aid 360 is an integrated digital ecosystem designed to streamline disaster response and recovery operations during large-scale flooding events. Traditional relief efforts often suffer from information silos and logistical bottlenecks; this project addresses these challenges by centralizing data from ground volunteers, government agencies, and donors into a single, cohesive platform. Utilizing real-time geospatial mapping and predictive analytics, Flood Aid 360 enables precise resource allocation, ensuring that food, medical supplies, and rescue teams reach the most vulnerable areas with minimal delay. The system features a multi-tiered interface for administrative oversight, field reporting, and public transparency, ultimately transforming chaotic data into actionable intelligence to save lives and optimize post-flood rehabilitation.
